# GEMINI.md - Project Context: Idony

This file provides the necessary architectural and operational context for the **Idony** project to ensure efficient and consistent assistance from Gemini.

## Project Overview

**Idony** is currently an empty project directory. Based on the project initialization command (`/init`), it is in its earliest stage of development. The directory serves as a fresh workspace, ready for the establishment of a new codebase or documentation repository.

- **Status:** Initialized / Empty
- **Project Type:** To be determined (Categorized as Non-Code Project for initial context)
- **Primary Goal:** Initialize and develop the Idony project from scratch.

## Directory Overview

As the project is newly initialized, the current structure is minimal:

- `/`: Root directory of the Idony project.
- `GEMINI.md`: This context file, providing instructions and project state to Gemini.

### Anticipated Structure

For a standard development project, the following directories are typically expected as the project grows:

- `src/`: Core source code or content.
- `docs/`: Project documentation and research.
- `tests/`: Automated test suites.
- `config/`: Configuration files for build systems or environments.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for automation.

## Usage

This project is ready for its first implementation steps. Gemini can assist in the following areas:

1. **Scaffolding:** Initializing the project with preferred frameworks (e.g., `npm init`, `cargo init`, `git init`).
2. **Planning:** Drafting requirements, architectural designs, or `README.md` content.
3. **Development:** Implementing the first features or documents once the project type is established.

### Commands

Currently, no project-specific build or test commands are defined. Once a project type is selected, key commands (e.g., `npm start`, `make build`, `pytest`) should be documented here.

## Development Conventions

As the project is currently a blank slate, no specific coding styles or contribution guidelines have been established yet. It is recommended to:

- Establish a consistent naming convention.
- Use a version control system (Git is recommended).
- Define testing and linting standards early in the development process.
